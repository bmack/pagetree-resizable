# pagetree-resizable

> Make the TYPO3 backend page tree container horizontally resizable again.

# Background

The possibility to change the width was removed in TYPO3 8.
This becomes a problem in bigger installations or when your tree structure is deeper (or simply the names of your pages are a little bit longer).
You would have to scroll a loooooot!

# What does it do?

This extension adds a little bit of Javascript and CSS to allow any user to resize the container horizontally again.

It works with TYPO3 8.7 LTS and TYPO3 9.5 LTS.

# Installation
